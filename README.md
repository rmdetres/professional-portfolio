# professional-portfolio

# https://rmdetres.github.io/professional-portfolio/
## my motivation for this project was to build out my portfolio and begin the first iteration
### I build this project for the above reason and to practice my html skills.
### This solves the problem of not having a central point where all my work can be accessed 
### I learned how to place items on pages in specific locations, how to link items with HTML.
